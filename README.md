CTIS477 - Systems Engineering Final Term Project (Smart Home Automation System with Arduino). 20/05/2021 

## Project Description
This project aims to make some operations smartly and remotely controllable in homes that are basic, daily routine operations. For example, opening and closing lights remotely or may be programmed to on/off according to day time.
